Cell-cell communications via secreting and receiving ligands frequently occur in multicellular organisms, which is a vital feature involving numerous biological processes.[[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32435978/) Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have effectively resolving cellular phenotype heterogeneity and cell-type composition of complex tissues, which enables systematic investigation of cell-cell communications at a single-cell resolution. However, the common practice to study chemical signal-dependent cell-cell communications with scRNA-seq relies heavily on the prior knowledge of ligand-receptor (LR) interaction pairs. Here, we introduce CellTalkDB, a comprehensive database of LR interaction pairs in human and mouse by text mining and manual verification of known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in STRING.
